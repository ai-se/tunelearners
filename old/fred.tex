Not only do static code defect predictors perform well compared to manual methods,
they also are competitive with certain automatic methods.
A recent study at ICSE'14, Rahman et al.~\cite{rahman14:icse} compared
(a) static code analysis tools FindBugs, Jlint, and Pmd and (b)
static code defect predictors
(which they called ``statistical defect prediction'') built using logistic regression.
They found  no significant differences in the cost-effectiveness
of these  approaches. Given this equivalence, it is significant to note that 
static code defect prediction can be quickly adapted to new languages by building lightweight
parsers that find   information like \tab{ck}. The same is not true for   static code analyzers-- these need  extensive modification before they can be used on new
languages.
