\begin{abstract}
One of the ``black arts'' of data mining is setting the tuning
parameters that control   choices within a data miner.  We offer a simple,
automatic, and very effective  method for finding those tunings.

For the purposes of learning
software defect predictors this optimization strategy can quickly
find  good tunings that  dramatically change   the performance of a learner.
For example,
in this paper we show   tunings that  alter detection  precision  
 from 2\% to 98\%.

These results prompt for a change to standard methods in software analytics.
At least for defect prediction, 
it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result
{\em without} first conducting a tuning optimization study.
The implications for other kinds of software analytics is now an open and pressing questions.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{raggedleft}
{\em ``So those who are last now will be first then, \\
and those who are first will be last.''}\\ 
-- Matthew 20:16

 \end{raggedleft}

In the $21^{st}$ century, it is now impossible
to manually browse all the available software project
data. The PROMISE repository of SE data has grown to 200+ projects~\cite{promise15}
and this is just one of over a dozen open-source repositories
that are readily available to researchers~\cite{rod12}.
For example,  the time of this writing (Feb  2015), our web searches show that Mozilla Firefox has over 1.1 million bug reports, and platforms such as GitHub host over 14 million projects. 



 
Faced with this information overload,
researchers in empirical SE
use  data miners  to (e.g.) generate 
defect predictors from static code measures.
Such   measures can be
automatically extracted from the code base, with very little effort
even for very large software systems~\cite{nagappan05}. 
In addition, they have  some generality
across multiple projects: e.g. defect
predictors developed at NASA~\cite{me07b} have also been successfully
applied in Turkey~\cite{tosun09}.
Such detectors reduce the effort required for 
defect prediction: if 
inspection teams let themselves be guided by defect predictors then
they can find 80\% to 88\% of the defects
after inspecting  20\% to 25\% of the code~\cite{ostrand04,tosun10}.


One of the ``black arts'' of data mining is setting the tuning
parameters that control  the choices within that data miner.
Many researchers have applied automatic optimizers to find good tunings.
The search-based SE community has   developed techniques
for tuning that treat parameters  as a configuration
search space~\cite{cora10,Krogmann10}. 
The field of {\em hyper-heuristics} explores methods for auto-adapting
options within the device searching for solutions~\cite{jia2013learning} in applications
like test-case generation and code refactorings.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first extensive exploration 
of applying automatic optimizers to tune data miners for defect prediction,
(though see~\cite{cora10,balogh12,Minku13,minku13z} for tuning effort estimators).
The one similar study  we can find in the period 2004 to 2014\footnote{See the GECCO and SSBSE proceedings at    goo.gl/2MY602 and goo.gl/uzvU8e.} was
Bouktiff et al.~\cite{Bouktif06} who used  simulated annealing to tune Bayes classifiers.
That was a very limited study, applied to a  single defect data set.
The analysis of this paper is far more extensive and offers the following novel result:
\bi
\item
Tuning static code defect predictors is {\em remarkably simple} and can {\em dramatically improve the performance}
of those learners. 
\ei
Prior to these experiments, our expectation was tuning
would be an  extensive and expensive evolutionary optimization procedure. 
A standard run of such evolutionary optimizers requires   thousands,
if not millions, of evaluations.
To
our surprise, we achieved dramatic improvements in the performance scores
of our data miners after  mere 50 to 80 evaluations (!!) of a very simple evolutionary 
optimizer  called differential evolution~\cite{storn1997differential}.
Better yet,  those  tunings (found so quickly)   
  have a dramatic change to the performance of a learner. For example,
in this paper we show that tuning can alter the precision of
a software defect predictor from 2\% to 98\%.

Our tuning results  challenge much prior work in software analytics. 
Firstly, there exist research papers
that use data miners to   show that certain factors
are more influential than others for (say)
predicting defects. As shown below, such conclusions can be dramatically
changed by the tuning process since those  ``influential'' factors are very different pre- and post- tuning. Also, those factors tend to  change from project to project or if the goal
of the tuning is altered.
Hence, many old papers    need to be revisted  and perhaps revised~\cite{bell2013limited,rahman2013how,me02k,moser2008comparative,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting}.  
For example, one of us (Menzies) used data miners
to assert that some factors were more important than others for predicting
successful software reuse~\cite{me02k}. That assertion should now be doubted since that
Menzies study did not conduct a tuning study before reporting what factors the data miners
found where most influential.

Secondly, several  prominent IEEE TSE papers~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11,me07b} have claimed 
that learnerX is better than learnerY for some software analytics task.
For example, a recent IEEE TSE article claimed that the 
CART decision tree learner was far worse than Random Forests for
software defect prediction~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking}. 
Such conclusions do not survive tuning.
For example,
after tuning, the worst untuned learner (CART) can out-perform the supposedly
best learner (Random Forests). Hence, all those prior results that ranked learners for software
analytics now need to be revisited and perhaps revised.

Thirdly, it is standard practice to use the default ``off-the-shelf'' tunings  for data mining tools (previously
we have defended that approach on methodological grounds arguing that it
encourages reproducibility~\cite{me15:book1}). That ``off-the-shelf''  policy
can no longer be condoned. For example, one such default setting
  in the Python \mbox{SciKitLearn} toolkit~\cite{scikit-learn}
is to use $F=10$ decision trees in  Random Forest classifiers.
Our optimizer settled on  $F$ values that were nowhere near that default:

{\scriptsize
\[F \in \left\{\begin{array}{l} 55,  65, 70,   82, 88, 96, 100,  102,  104, 107,\\
                                108,  119, 133,  140, 140,   147,  145,  142   \end{array}\right\}
\]}


In summary,it is now an open and pressing research issue to check if
analytics without parameter tuning is considered {\em harmful} or, at the 
very least, {\em misleading}.
Clearly, we must now doubt  conclusions based on
``off-the-shelf'' tunings.
Further,
it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and report the result
{\em without} first conducting an tuning optimizations study.

 

\subsection{Preliminaries}

Before beginning, we offer four caveats on these results.

Firstly, we are {\em not} saying that {\em all} learning requires
tuning. For example, when proposing fixes to software, Weimar et al. use a genetic learner
to propose patches~\cite{Weimer:2009}. Consider one performance criteria for that work; i.e. 
that   that that method can find and fix known bugs. Note that this is a {\em competency criteria}
which does not include the phrase  ``{\em better than}''. Such performance criteria do
not requiring tuning.  However, once {\em better than} enters the performance criteria
(as done in \cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11,me07b,bell2013limited,rahman2013how,me02k,moser2008comparative,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting})
then this becomes a race between competing methods (or attributes).  In such a race, it is unfair
to hobble one competitor with poor tunings. 
 

Secondly, the tuning results shown here only came from one  software analytics task 
(defect prediction from static code attributes).
There are many other kinds of software analytics tasks 
(software development effort estimation, social network mining,
detecting duplicate issue reports, etc) and the implication of this
study for those tasks is unclear. 
However,  those other tasks often use the same kinds of learners
explored in this paper so it is quite possible that
the conclusions of this paper apply to other SE analytics tasks as well. 


Thirdly, this paper explores {\em some} learners using {\em one}  optimizer. Hence, it makes
no claim that this is the {\em best} optimizer for {\em all} learners.
Rather, our point is that there exists at least some learners
whose performance can be dramatically improved by 
at least one simple optimization scheme.  We hope that this work inspires
much future work as this community develops and debugs best practices for tuning
software analytics.

Fourthly, it would be incorrect to say that this paper is arguing that
software analytics is somehow wrong-headed, misguided, and we should not do it anymore.
In the age of the Internet and global access to software engineering data,
there exists the  problem of information overload. {\em Something} must be done to
allow analysts to make conclusions via an automatic analysis over a lot of data.
The results of this paper is that for a particular local context
(a specific data set and a specific goal) there exists  
methods for optimizing the conclusions reached in that context.  Those conclusions
may not generalize to other contexts but this  is not a council for despair. While there may
not exist general conclusions, there does seem to exist general methods for finding
local conclusions in a particular context. Further, as shown below, those
methods may be very simple to implement and very fast to execute.

\section{Motivating Example}\label{sect:eg}

This section offers a small demonstration
of the impact of tuning parameters. It also demonstrates that this issue of tuning effects 
not just the complex data miners discussed later in the paper but also 
applies for even very simple  learning schemes.


One way to generate a  defect predictor from
static code is to use 
linear  regression.
This is a standard statistical
method that fits a straight line to a set of points. The line
offers a set of predicted values.
If the points are somewhat
scattered, then a single regression line cannot pass through all points and the distance from these predicted values to the actual
values is a measure of the error associated with that line.
Linear regression search for a line that minimizes that
error and maximizes the correlation\footnote{
$Correlation$
measures how closely two variables co-vary.  It ranges from   from -1
(perfect negative correlation) through 0 (no correlation) to +1
 (perfect positive correlation).
Let  $a_i$ and $p_i$ denote some actual and predicted values respectively; and  $n$ and $\overline{x}$ denote
 the number of observations and the mean of the $n$ observations, 
respectively. Then:
$S_{\mathit{PA}}=(\sum_i (p_i - \overline{p})(a_i -
  \overline{a}))/(n-1)$ and
$S_{p}=(\sum_i (p_i - \overline{p})^2)(n-1)$
and 
$S_{a}=(\sum_i (a_i - \overline{a})^2)/(n-1)$ and
correlation is  $c=S_{\mathit{PA}}/\sqrt{S_pS_a}$.}  denoted as $c$.

Suppose  a researcher wants to use linear regression
to test if Halstead's~\cite{halstead77} measures
of   function complexity
(number of symbols programmers has to understand) are   {\em better than}
mere lines of code for predicting
software defects.  That researcher might argue that Halstead's cognitive approach to
software bugs is better suited to code refactoring tools since it offers 
more ways to alter functions that just some coarse grain lines of code measure.


That researcher might test that belief by using studying historical
defect logs with 
linear regression. Here are two equations (learned from the NASA data at goo.gl/pGDfvp)
that use just lines of code or the Halstead measures $N,V,L,D,I,E,B,T$ seen in a
software module (in this case, a  function).
Note that the Halstead correlation $c_2$
is worse than those from lines of code $c_1$. This result  seems to suggest that
despite their potential support for refactoring, our researchers should not use Halstead.

{\scriptsize \[
\begin{array}{l|l|ll}
\mathit{measures} & d= \mathit{\#defects} & \mathit{correlation}\\\hline
\mathit{LOC}   &d_i= 0.0164 +0.0114\mathit{LOC}\ & c_1 = 0.65\\\hline
\mathit{Halstead} & d_2= 0.231 + 0.00344N     \\    
                 & +  0.0009V   - 0.185L \\
                 & - 0.0343D      - 0.00541I \\
                 & + 0.000019E + 0.711B \\ 
                 &   - 0.00047T  & c_2=-0.36  
\end{array}
\]
}
 

\noindent
Enter tuning. Suppose the defect predictors $d_1$ and $d_2$  learned from LOC or Halstead
are used to to call an inspection
team to check for errors in certain parts of the code using the rule
\begin{equation}\label{eq:yesno}\scriptsize
\mathit{inspect}= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
d_i \ge T \rightarrow \mathit{Yes}\\
d_i <   T \rightarrow \mathit{No} 
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\fig{pd1} shows the effects of tuning the $T$ variable. Not surprisingly,
at $T=0$, all modules get inspected so the false alarm rate is very high. To reduce that
problem, we can increase $T$. \fig{pd1} reports that the false alarm rate falls below
20\% at $T=0.45$ (for Halstead).

  probability of recognizing defective modules  seen using \mbox{$d_i \ge T$}.

 }\label{fig:pd1}
 \end{figure}


One  important lesson from  \fig{pd1} is that the ``best'' tunings are context
specific. For mission critical systems (e.g. a nuclear power plant), management
might accept the cost of high false alarm rates if it meant increasing the probability
of detecting errors. For such contexts, we might recommend some very small value of $T$.

The other  important lesson from   \fig{pd1}  is that, with tuning, a seemingly poor
detector can work just as well as seemingly better ones.
Note that either the Halstead or LOC detector can reach some desired
level of recall, regardless of their correlations, just by
selecting the appropriate threshold value. For example, in \fig{pd1}, see the recall=75\% values
found at {\em either} $d_i\ge 0.65$ or $d_2\ge 0.45$ (and at the threshold, the false alarm rates
were very similar: 14\% and 19\%).

The core point of this example is that    the true value of a detector
could not be assessed {\em without} conducting a  tuning study in the context of some business case (in this case, 
issuing a request to an inspection team to review some module).  
This is strong motivation to explore the issue of tunings.



\section{Background Notes}



The rest of this paper repeats the analysis of the last section, but for much
more complex learners. In those results, shown  below, we will find
examples of {\em rank reversals};
i.e.  after tuning the top ranked defector becomes last and vice versa.
Such examples motivate the extensive exploration of tuning in software analytics.
Before presenting those results, this section offers some background notes on defect prediction,
performance measures, and optimization with differential evolution.

\subsection{Defect Prediction}


This section is our standard introduction to defect prediction~\cite{me15:book1},
plus   some new results from Rahman et al.'s   2014 FSE paper~\cite{rahman14:icse}.

\subsection{Data Mining Algorithms}
 
\input{learners}

\subsubsection{Differential Evolution: The Details}
 
 
The psuedocode for differential evolution is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE}.
Note that, as we describe the algorithm,
  any superscript number denotes a line in that algorithm.


DE is an evolutionary algorithm; i.e. the next {\em NewGeneration} is learnt from
a current {\em Population}.  If the new is no better than the current, then
we lose one life, terminating when we run out of lives$^5$.

Each candidate solution in the {\em Population}  
is a pair of {\em (Tunings, Scores)}. In this paper, {\em Tunings} are selected from
\fig{parameters} and {\em Scores} come from training a learner using those parameters
and applying it to some test data$^{23-28}$.

The premise of this algorithm is that the best way to mutate existing tunings
is to {\em Extrapolate}$^{29}$
between current solutions.  Three solutions $a,b,c$ are selected at random.
For each tuning parameter $i$, at some probability {\em cr}, we replace
the old tuning $x_i$ with $y_i$ found as follows:
\bi
\item (For numerics) $y_i = a_i+f \times (b_i - c_i)$   where $f$ is a parameter
controlling the cross-over amount.  The {\em trim} function$^{39}$ limits the new
value to the legal range min..max of that parameter.
\item (For booleans) $y_i= \neg x_i$ (see line 37).
\ei
The main loop of DE$^7$ runs over the {\em Population}, replacing old items
with new {\em Candidate}s (if the new candidate is better than the old item).
This means that, as the loop progresses, the {\em Population} is full of increasiningly
more valuable solutions. This, in turn, also improves  the candidates (which are generated
from the {\em Population}.

For this experiments of this paper, we collect performance
values from a data mining, from which a {\em Goal} function extracts one 
performance value$^{27}$ (so we tun this code many times, each time with
a different {\em Goal}$^2$).  Technically, this makes this a  {\em single objective} DE (and for notes on multi-objective DEs, see~\cite{Coello05,zhang07,5583335}).

\section{Experimental Design}

The following experimental aims to compare the performance of three learners, tuned and untuned, on 17
sets of data. 

\subsection{Data Sets}

Our defect data comes from the PROMISE repository\footnote{http://openscience.us/repo}.
It pertains to 
open source Java systems defined in terms of \fig{ck}:  {\it ant}, {\it camel}, {\it ivy}, {\it jedit}, {\it log4j}, {\it lucene}, {\it 
synapse}, {\it velocity}, {\it xalan} and {\it xerces}. 

An important principle in data mining is not to test on the data used
in training.  There are many ways to design a experiment that satisfies this principle.
Some of those methods have certain drawbacks:
\bi
\item  Leave-one-out is too slow for large data sets;
\item Cross-validation can mix up older and newer data sets so it may well be that
data from the {\em future} is used to test on {\em past data}.
\ei
To avoid these problems, we used an incremental learning approach. The following
experiment ensures that the training data was created at some time before the test
data.

For this experiment, we looked for data sets that had at least three  
releases in PROMISE. Note that the following ensures that all treatments 
get assessed on the same test  set.
\bi 
\item The {\em first} release was used for some  {\em training}, to collect a baseline
   using an untuned learner.
   \item
   The {\em first} release was also used  on line 24 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE} to
   build some model using some the tunings found in some {\em Candidate}.
   \item The {\em second} release was used on 25 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE} to 
   test the model found on line 24.
   \item Finally the {\em third} release was used to gather the performance statistics
   reported below from (a)~the model generated by the untuned learner or (b)~the
   best model found by differential evolution.
   \ei
Some data sets have more than three releases and, for those data, we could run more
 than one experiment. For example, {\em ant} has five versions in PROMISE so
 we ran three experiments called V0,V1,V2:
 \bi
 \item AntV0: first,second,third = versions 1,2,3
 \item AntV1: first,second,third = versions 2,3,4
 \item AntV2: first,second,third = versions 3,4,5
 \ei 
These data sets are displayed in \fig{data1} and \fig{data2}.

\subsection{Optimization Goals}

Recall from Algorithm~! that we call differential evolution one time for each
goal we are trying to optimize. This section lists those optimization goals.

Let $\{A,B,C,D\}$ denote the
true negatives, 
false negatives, 
false positives, and 
true positives
(respectively) found by a binary detector. 
Certain standard measures can be computed from
$A,B,C,D$: 
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
pd=recall=&\frac{D}{B+D}\\
pf=&\frac{C}{A+C}\\
pf'=& 1 - pf\\
prec=precision=&\frac{D}{D+C}\\ 
 g = & \frac{2*pd*pf'}{pd + pf'}
\end{array}
\]
All the above vary from zero to one. For $pf$, the {\em better} scores and {\em smaller}.
For all other scores, the {\em better} scores are {\em larger}.

The following results make no assumption that (e.g.) minimizing false alarms are 
more important that maximizing recall or precision. That determination 
should be make with respect to current business conditions:
\bi
\item
For safety critical applications, low false alarm rates are irrelevant since the cost
of overlooking any critical might outweigh the inconvenience of having to inspect a few more
modules. 
\item
On the other hand, when rushing a product to market before a competing product is released, there is a business case to 
avoid the extra rework associated with false alarms.  In that business context, 
managers might be willing to lower the recall somewhat in order to minimize the false alarms.
\ei
What the falling results do show is that once the optimization goal changes, so does everything
else. Hence, it is important not to overstate  empirical results from software analytics.
Rather, those results need to be expressed {\em along with} the context within which they are
relevant.

\section{Experimental Results}

The introduction of this article made several claims about tuning defect predictor
that use static code attributes. This section presents
our results in order of those claims:
\be
\item Such tuning was easy (see \tion{easy});
\item Such tuning is fast (see \tion{fast});
\item Such tuning is can dramatically change the performance scores of a predictor;
e.g. one result where precision changes from 2\% to 98\% (see \tion{precision});
\item Tuning changes conclusions about what factors are most important (see \tion{import});
\item Tuning changes conclusions about what learners are better than others (see \tion{rank};)
\ee

\subsection{Tuning is Easy}

All the following results are generated with a a very simple optimizer
(differential evolution). Further, our DE  is actually much simpler
than a standard implementation. Recall from Algorithm~1 that
DE explores a {\em Population} of size {\em np=10}. This is a very small population size:
the standard recommendation is to set {\em np} to be ten times larger than the number
of attributes being optimized~\cite{stron97}


The results of this paper are presented

\subsection{Implications}

time for an end to era of data mining in se? moving on to a new phase of learning-as-optimization

1) learning is actually an optimization tasks (e.g. see fig2 of  learners climbing the roc curve hill in http://goo.gl/x2EaAm)

2) our learners are all contorted to do some tasks X (e.g. minimize expected value of entropy), then we assess them on score Y (recall). which is nuts. maybe we should build the goal predicate into the learner (e.g http://menzies.us/pdf/10which.pdf) 

3) given 1 + 2, maybe the whole paradigm of optimizing param selection is wrong. maybe what we need is a library of bees buzzing around making random choices (e.g. about descritziation) which other bees use, plus their own random choices (e.g. max depth of tree learned from discretized data) which is used by other bees, plus their own random choices (e.g. business users reading the models).  the funky thing here is that it can take some time before some of the bees (the discretizers) get feedback from the community of people using their decision (the tree learners).
