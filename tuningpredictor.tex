One of the ``black arts'' of data mining is setting the tuning
parameters that control  the miner.  We offer a simple,
automatic, and very effective  method for finding those tunings.
For the purposes of learning
software defect predictors this  methid can quickly
find  good tunings that  dramatically change   the performance of a learner.
For example,
in this paper we show   tunings that  alter detection  precision  
 from 2\% to 98\%.

These results prompt for a change to standard methods in software analytics.
At least for defect prediction, 
it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result
{\em without}  conducting a tuning optimization study.
The implications for other kinds of  analytics is now  an open and pressing issue.

\section{Introduction}
 
In the $21^{st}$ century, it is now impossible
to manually browse all the available software project
data. The PROMISE repository of SE data has grown to 200+ projects~\cite{promise15}
and this is just one of over a dozen open-source repositories
that are readily available to researchers~\cite{rod12}.
For example,  the time of this writing (Feb  2015), our web searches show that Mozilla Firefox has over 1.1 million bug reports, and platforms such as GitHub host over 14 million projects. 



 
Faced with this information overload,
researchers in empirical SE
use  data miners  to generate 
defect predictors from static code measures.
Such   measures can be
automatically extracted from the code base, with very little effort
even for very large software systems~\cite{nagappan05}. 

One of the ``black arts'' of data mining is setting the tuning
parameters that control  the choices within that data miner.
Prior to this work, our intuition was that tuning would change the behavior or a data miner, to some degree. Nevertheless, we rarely tuned our  defect predictors 
since we reasoned
that a data miner's default tunings have been well-explored by the developers of those algorithms (in which case
tuning would not lead to large performance improvements).
Also, we suspected that
tuning would take so long and be so CPU intensive that the benefits gained   would not be worth effort.

The results of this paper show that neither of these points is supportable, at least when learning
defect detectors from static code attributes since:
\bi
\item
Tuning static code defect predictors is {\em remarkably simple} and can {\em dramatically improve the performance}. 
\ei
Prior to these experiments, our expectation was tuning
would be an  extensive and expensive evolutionary optimization procedure. 
A standard run of such evolutionary optimizers requires   thousands,
if not millions, of evaluations.
To
our surprise, we achieved dramatic improvements in the performance scores
of our data miners after  mere 50 to 80 evaluations (!!) of a very simple evolutionary 
optimizer  called differential evolution~\cite{storn1997differential}.
Better yet,  those  tunings (found so quickly)   
  have a dramatic change to the performance of a learner. For example,
in this paper we show that tuning can alter the precision of
a software defect predictor from 2\% to 98\%.

These results challenge much prior work. 
Firstly, there exist research papers
that use data miners to   show that certain factors
are more influential than others for (say)
predicting defects. As shown below, such conclusions can be dramatically
changed by the tuning process since those  ``influential'' factors are very different pre- and post- tuning. Also, those factors tend to  change from project to project or if the goal
of the tuning is altered.
Hence, many old papers    need to be revisted  and perhaps revised~\cite{bell2013limited,rahman2013how,me02k,moser2008comparative,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting}.  
For example, one of us (Menzies) used data miners
to assert that some factors were more important than others for predicting
successful software reuse~\cite{me02k}. That assertion should now be doubted since that
Menzies study did not conduct a tuning study before reporting what factors the data miners
found where most influential.

Secondly, several  prominent IEEE TSE papers~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11,me07b} have claimed 
that learnerX is better than learnerY for some software analytics task.
For example, a recent IEEE TSE article claimed that the 
CART decision tree learner was far worse than Random Forests for
software defect prediction~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking}. 
Such conclusions do not survive tuning.
For example,
after tuning, the worst untuned learner (CART) can out-perform the supposedly
best learner (Random Forests). Hence, all those prior results that ranked learners for software
analytics now need to be revisited and perhaps revised.

Thirdly, it is standard practice to use the default ``off-the-shelf'' tunings  for data mining tools (previously
we have defended that approach, arguing that it
encourages reproducibility~\cite{me15:book1}). That ``off-the-shelf''  policy
can no longer be condoned. For example, suppose our default
number of trees in  a Random Forest was   $F=100$ (which is the default in our implementation). 
After tuning, we see that our optimizer often used $F$ values that were nowhere near that default:

% {\scriptsize
% \[F \in \left\{\begin{array}{l} 55,  65, 70,   82, 88, 96, 100,  102,  104, 107,\\
%                                 108,  119, 133,  140, 140,   147,  145,  142   \end{array}\right\}
% \]}


% {\scriptsize
% \[F \in \left\{\begin{array}{l} 50, 59, 63, 63, 69, 71, 81, 85,85, 88,\\

%                                 131, 132, 135, 140, 141, 141, 150   \end{array}\right\}
% \]}



{\scriptsize
\[F \in \left\{\begin{array}{l} 50, 58, 59, 63, 63, 66, 67, 73, 74, 74, \\
                                75, 77, 80, 82, 85, 96, 96, 97, 97, 101, \\

\]}

In summary, it is now an open and pressing research issue to check if
analytics without parameter tuning is considered {\em harmful} or, at the 
very least, {\em misleading}.
Clearly, we  now doubt  conclusions based on
``off-the-shelf'' tunings.
Further,
it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and report the result
{\em without} first conducting an tuning optimizations study.

Before beginning, we digress for one  clarification.
This paper is {\bf not} arguing that
software analytics is somehow wrong-headed or misguided.
In the age of the Internet and global access to software engineering data,
there exists the  problem of information overload. {\em Something} must be done to
allow analysts to make conclusions via an automatic analysis over a lot of data.
The results of this paper is that for a particular local context
(a specific data set and a specific goal) there exists  
methods for optimizing the conclusions reached in that context.  
Those conclusions
may not generalize to other contexts but this  is not a council for despair. 
As shown here, 
there  exists general methods for finding
local conclusions in a particular context. Further,
those
methods are  very simple to implement and very fast to execute.


\section{Motivating Example}\label{sect:eg}

This section is  a  demonstration
of the impact of tuning.


Linear  regression fits a  line to a set of points in order to minimize  predictive
error and maximizes the correlation\footnote{
{\em Correlation}
measures how closely two variables co-vary.  It ranges from   from -1
(perfect negative correlation) through 0 (no correlation) to +1
 (perfect positive correlation).
Let  $a_i$ and $p_i$ denote some actual and predicted values respectively; and  $n$ and $\overline{x}$ denote
 the number of observations and the mean of the $n$ observations, 
respectively. Then:
$S_{\mathit{PA}}=(\sum_i (p_i - \overline{p})(a_i -
  \overline{a}))/(n-1)$ and
$S_{p}=(\sum_i (p_i - \overline{p})^2)(n-1)$
and 
$S_{a}=(\sum_i (a_i - \overline{a})^2)/(n-1)$ and
correlation is  $c=S_{\mathit{PA}}/\sqrt{S_pS_a}$.}  denoted as $c$.
Suppose  a researcher wants to use linear regression
to test if Halstead's~\cite{halstead77} measures
of   function complexity
(number of symbols programmers has to understand) are   {\em better than}
mere lines of code for predicting
software defects.  That researcher might believe that Halstead's cognitive approach to
software bugs is better suited to code refactoring tools since it offers 
more ways to alter functions that just some coarse grain lines of code measure.


To test that belief, our  researcher applies regression to  some defect logs.
 Here are two equations (learned from the NASA data at goo.gl/pGDfvp)
that use just lines of code or the Halstead measures $N,V,L,D,I,E,B,T$ seen in a
software module (in this case, a  function).
Note that the Halstead correlation $c_2$
is worse than the $c_1$ correlation  from lines of code-- which suggests
 our researcher should not use Halstead .

{\scriptsize \[
\begin{array}{l|l|ll}
\mathit{measures} & d= \mathit{\#defects} & \mathit{correlation}\\\hline
\mathit{LOC}   &d_1= 0.0164 +0.0114\mathit{LOC}\ & c_1 = 0.65\\\hline
\mathit{Halstead} & d_2= 0.231 + 0.00344N  +  0.0009V    \\    
                 &   - 0.185L- 0.0343D      - 0.00541I  \\ 
                 & + 0.000019E + 0.711B  - 0.00047T  & c_2=-0.36  
\end{array}
\]
}
 

\noindent
We now explore how tuning can change the above  conclusion. Suppose the  predictors $d_1$ and $d_2$  learned from LOC or Halstead
are used to call an inspection
team to check for errors in   parts of the code using:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:yesno}\scriptsize
\mathit{inspect}= \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
d_i \ge T \rightarrow \mathit{Yes}\\
d_i <   T \rightarrow \mathit{No} 
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}
\fig{pd1} shows the effects of tuning. Not surprisingly,
at $T=0$, all modules get inspected so the false alarm rate is very high. To reduce that
problem, we can increase $T$:   the false alarm rate falls below
20\% at $T=0.45$ (for Halstead).

 }\label{fig:pd1}
 \end{figure}
 
Note that either the Halstead or LOC detector can reach some desired
level of recall, regardless of their correlations, just by
selecting the appropriate threshold value. For example, in \fig{pd1}, see the recall=75\% values
found at {\em either} $d_i\ge 0.65$ or $d_2\ge 0.45$ (and at the threshold, the false alarm rates
were very similar: 14\% and 19\%).

The  point here is that   the true value of a detector
could not be assessed {\em without} conducting a  tuning study in the context of some business case (in this case, 
issuing a request to an inspection team to review some module).  
Hence, it is important to explore tuning
so the rest of this paper repeats the analysis of this section, but for 
more complex learners.

\subsection{Data Mining Algorithms}
 
\input{learners} 
 
The psuedocode for differential evolution is shown in Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE}.
Note that, as we describe the algorithm,
  any superscript number denotes a line in that algorithm.


DE is an evolutionary algorithm where next {\em NewGeneration} is learnt from
a current {\em Population}.  If the new is no better than  current, then
we lose one life (terminating when lives is zero)$^5$.

Each candidate solution in the {\em Population}  
is a pair of {\em (Tunings, Scores)}.  {\em Tunings} are selected from
\fig{parameters} and {\em Scores} come from training a learner using those parameters
and applying it     test data$^{23-28}$.

The premise of DE  is that the best way to mutate existing tunings
is to {\em Extrapolate}$^{29}$
between current solutions.  Three solutions $a,b,c$ are selected at random.
For each tuning parameter $i$, at some probability {\em cr}, we replace
the old tuning $x_i$ with $y_i$:
\bi
\item (For numerics) $y_i = a_i+f \times (b_i - c_i)$   where $f$ is a parameter
controlling the cross-over amount.  The {\em trim} function$^{39}$ limits the new
value to the legal range min..max of that parameter.
\item (For booleans) $y_i= \neg x_i$ (see line 37).
\ei
The main loop of DE$^7$ runs over the {\em Population}, replacing old items
with new {\em Candidate}s (if the new candidate is better than the old item).
This means that, as the loop progresses, the {\em Population} is full of increasiningly
more valuable solutions. This, in turn, also improves  the candidates, which are generated
from the {\em Population}.

For the experiments of this paper, we collect performance
values from a data mining, from which a {\em Goal} function extracts one 
performance value$^{27}$ (so we run this code many times, each time with
a different {\em Goal}$^2$).  Technically, this makes a  {\em single objective} DE (and for notes on multi-objective DEs, see~\cite{Coello05,zhang07,5583335}).

\section{Experimental Design}\label{sect:design}

The following experiment aims to compare the performance of three learners, tuned and untuned, on 17
sets of data. 

\subsection{Data Sets}\label{sect:dataa}

Our defect data comes from the PROMISE repository\footnote{http://openscience.us/repo}.
It pertains to 
open source Java systems defined in terms of \fig{ck}:  {\it ant}, {\it camel}, {\it ivy}, {\it jedit}, {\it log4j}, {\it lucene},
{\it poi},{\it synapse}, {\it velocity} and {\it xerces}. 

An important principle in data mining is not to test on the data used
in training.  There are many ways to design a experiment that satisfies this principle.
Some of those methods have  limitations:
\bi
\item  Leave-one-out is too slow for large data sets;
\item Cross-validation can mix up older and newer data sets so it may well be that
data from the {\em future} is used to test on {\em past data}.
\ei
To avoid these problems, we used an incremental learning approach. The following
experiment ensures that the training data was created at some time before the test
data.

For this experiment, we use data sets with at least three  
consecutive releases  (where release $i+1$ was built after release $i$).
\bi 
\item The {\em first} release was used for some  {\em training}, to collect a baseline
   using an untuned learner. This release is also used  on line 24 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE} to
   build some model using some the tunings found in some {\em Candidate}.
   \item The {\em second} release was used on 25 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:DE} to 
   test the model found on line 24.
   \item Finally the {\em third} release was used to gather the performance statistics
   reported below from (a)~the model generated by the untuned learner or (b)~the
   best model found by differential evolution.
   \ei
This approach ensures   all treatments 
are assessed on the same tests. Note that we did consider
one other experimental design but rejected it for reasons of
internal validity (see \tion{construct}).

Some data sets have more than three releases and, for those data, we could run more
 than one experiment. For example, {\em ant} has five versions in PROMISE so
 we ran three experiments called V0,V1,V2:
 \bi
 \item AntV0: first,second,third = versions 1,2,3
 \item AntV1: first,second,third = versions 2,3,4
 \item AntV2: first,second,third = versions 3,4,5
 \ei 
These data sets are displayed in \fig{data1}.

\end{figure*} 

\subsection{Optimization Goals}

Recall from Algorithm~1 that we call differential evolution once for each
 optimization goal. This section lists those optimization goals.

Let $\{A,B,C,D\}$ denote the
true negatives, 
false negatives, 
false positives, and 
true positives
(respectively) found by a binary detector. 
Certain standard measures can be computed from
$A,B,C,D$: 

{\scriptsize\[
\begin{array}{ll}
pd=recall=&D/(B+D)\\
pf=&C/(A+C)\\ 
prec=precision=&D/(D+C) \\
F =&2*pd*prec/(pd + prec)
\end{array}
\]}

All the above vary from zero to one. For $pf$, the {\em better} scores are {\em smaller}.
For all other scores, the {\em better} scores are {\em larger}.
One technical detail:   {\em prec}
and {\em F} refer to {\em both} the defect and non-defective modules. This is different to {\em pf} and {\em recall} which only
refer to either non-defective or defective modules (repsectively).


\begin{figure}[!b]
\small
\begin{tabular}{|p{.95\linewidth}|}\hline
One style
of measure is to check the {\em variability} of that predictor.
For example,
in their study on reproducibility of SE results,
 Anda, Sjoberg and Mockus advocate using the coefficient of variation ($CV=\frac{stddev}{mean}$).
Using this measure, they defined {\em reproducibility} as $\frac{1}{CV}$~\cite{anda09}.

There exist other goals that combine defect prediction with other economic
factors.
Arisholm~\&~Briand~\cite{arisholm06},  Ostrand \& Weyeuker~\cite{ostrand04} and Rahman et al.~\cite{rahman12}
say that a defect predictor should maximizing {\em reward}; i.e. find the fewest lines of code
that contain the most bugs.

Yin et al. are concerned about
 {\em incorrect bug fixes}; i.e. those that require subsequent work in order to complete the bug fix.
These bugs occur  when (say) developers try to fix parts of the code
where they have very little experience~\cite{yin11}.  To avoid such incorrect bug fixes, we have to optimize
for finding the most number of bugs in regions that {\em the most programmers have worked with before}.

In {\em Better-faster-cheaper},   managers want changes that lead
to fewer defects,  faster development,  using less resources~\cite{Green,elrawas08,elrawas10,me07f,me09a,me09f}.

Another  {\em  rush-to-market} approach is yet another economic-based optimization measure.
A learner that tries to maximize ``rush-to-market'' is trying to release the product as soon
as possible, without too many bugs. Note that ``rush-to-market'' is an appropriate strategy for a company competing
in a volatile and crowded market place where being first-to-market enables a revenue stream (that can be
used to subsequently fix any issues with version 1.0)~\cite{huang06}.\\\hline

Our analysis results make no assumption that (e.g.) minimizing false alarms is 
more important than maximizing   precision. That determination 
depends on current business conditions:
\be
\item
For safety critical applications, high false alarm rates may be acceptable if the cost
of overlooking any critical can outweigh the inconvenience of having to inspect a few more
modules. 
\item
On the other hand, when rushing a product to market before a competing product is released, there is a business case to 
avoid the extra rework associated with false alarms.  In that business context, 
managers might be willing to lower the recall somewhat in order to minimize the false alarms.
\ee
These two examples are just the tip of the iceberg (see other criteria in \fig{criteria})
and there is insufficient space in this paper to explore all the above optimization goals.
What we can do, however, is show examples of how  changing  optimization goals can also change 
the conclusions made from that learner on that data. Those examples only relate to precision, recall, and the F-measure
but the general principle (that the search bias changes the search conclusions) would hold for all the goals
listed in the previous paragraph.  Hence, we warn that it is important not to overstate  empirical results from software analytics.
Rather, those results need to be expressed {\em along with} the context within which they are
relevant (and by ``context'', we mean the optimization goal).


\section{Experimental Results}

The introduction of this article made several claims about tuning defect predictor
that use static code attributes. This section presents
support for those claims:
\be
\item  Tuning    improves the performance scores of a predictor;
e.g.  precision changes from 2\% to 98\%: see \tion{precision};
\item Tuning changes conclusions on what learners are better than others: see \tion{rank};
\item Tuning changes conclusions about what factors are most important: see \tion{import};
\item  Tuning is easy: see \tion{easy};
\item Tuning is fast: see \tion{fast};
\item Data miners should not be used ``off-the-shelf'' with their default tunings: see \tion{variance}.
\ee


One comment before continuing. The following text does not
show results for tuning on recall
or false alarms. The reason is that false alarm and recall focus on {\em only}
the non-defective and defective modules (respectively). Hence:
\bi
\item
When DE tunes for recall, we can achieve near
100\% recall-- but the cost of a near 100\% false alarms.
\item
Similarly, the tuner
could achieve near zero false alarm rates by effectively turning off
the detector (driving recall to zero).
\ei
Hence, in the
following, we explore performance measures that comment on all the possible
target classes (i.e. precision and ``F'').

\subsection{Tuning Can  Improves Performance Scores}\label{sect:precision}

\fig{precisionbars} shows precision results before and after tuning using three different learners.
For each data set, the maximum precision values for each data set are shown in {\bf bold}.


These results offer support for the prior conclusions of  
 Lessmann et al.~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking} (that CART is worse than Random Forest):
\bi
\item
Untuned CART is indeed the worst learner (only one of its
untuned results is best and {\bf bold}). 
\item 
In $\frac{13}{17}$ cases, the performance of untuned Random Forest is better than or equal to untuned CART.  
\ei
% Some of the data sets in \fig{precisionbars} proved challenging for all learners;
% e.g. the precision results for {\em ivy} are less
% that impressive.
% To some extent, this is due to
% the properties of   the data set (as shown in \fig{data1}, defective classes in {\em ivy} are very rare in tuning data).

That said,  tuning can improve those poor performing detectors:
\bi
\item
For {\em jeditV2}, nearly all learners report precisions of under 20\%. But tuned  WHERE scores a 98\% precision.  
\item A similar pattern can be seen in results from {\em ivy},   and {\em xercesV0}.
In those two data sets, nearly all the precision values are   low {\em except} for
tuned WHERE that scored 89\% and 85\%.
\ei
Finally, note the  {\em jeditV2} result for the WHERE learner.
Here, tuning changes precision from 2\% to 98\%.

\fig{deltas} shows that tuning usually has a positive effect on performance scores. This figure sorts
the deltas in the precision and the F-measure    between tuned and untuned learners. Our reading of this
figure is that, overall, tuning rarely makes performance   worse and usually can make it much better.

\caption{Deltas in performance  seen in \fig{precisionbars} (left)
and \fig{fbars} (right) between tuned and untuned learners. Tuning improves performance when the deltas are above zero.}\label{fig:deltas}
 \end{figure}

\subsection{Tuning Changes the Rankings of Learner  }\label{sect:rank}
Researchers often use performance criteria to assert that one learner is better than another~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11,me07b}.
Such conclusions are   not reliable since they can change when we elect to tune for different goals. 

For example, given the poor showing of untuned CART and the good performance of tuned WHERE
in   \fig{precisionbars}, we might recommend
{\em not} to use CART and {\em always} used tuned WHERE. In turns out that this
conclusion is not stable across the tuning process.


\fig{fbars} shows what happens when we tune for the f-measure. 
As before, untuned Random Forest generally beats CART. However:
\bi
\item
In  a result that is the direct opposite of   
 Lessmann et al.~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking}, tuned CART does better than Random Forest;
 \item 
 In another result that is the reverse of \fig{precisionbars}, tuned WHERE is not necessarily
 any better than anything else.
 \ei
The lesson here is that, given a particular task (e.g. optimizing for precision), tuning can offer
substantial benefits. However, when that task changes (e.g. to optimizing for the F-measure),
it should not be assumed that conclusions from the previous tuning will hold in the new context.
In practice, this means that tuning needs to be repeated for each new context.

\subsection{Tuning Changes the Ranking of Project Factors  }\label{sect:import}


Researchers often use data miners to  test what factors have most impact on software projects~\cite{bell2013limited,rahman2013how,me02k,moser2008comparative,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting}. 
\fig{counts} shows that such conclusions are not reliable since they can be changed by tuning.
This figure shows what attributes appeared in WHERE's final decision trees when optimizing for different goals.
Note that the counts in the {\em tuned} column are   usually
different to those in the {\em default} columns (the tuned learners used more attributes
than otherwise as witnessed by the taller columns of numbers in the ``tuned'' column). 




\subsection{Tuning is Easy}\label{sect:easy}

In terms of the search space
explored via tuning, optimizing defect prediction from static code
measures is much {\em smaller} than standard optimization.

To see this,
recall from Algorithm~1 that
DE explores a {\em Population} of size {\em np=10}. This is a very small population size since
Rainer Storn (one of the inventors of DE) recommends  setting {\em np} to be ten times larger than the number
of attributes being optimized~\cite{storn1997differential}.

From \fig{parameters},
we see that Storn would therefore recommend {\em np} values of
90, 50, 60 for WHERE, CART and Random Forests (respectively). Yet we achieve our results
using a constant {\em np=10}; i.e. $\frac{10}{90}, \frac{10}{50}, \frac{10}{60}$ of the
recommended search space.

Another measure showing that tuning is easy 
(for static code defect predictors)
is the number of evaluations required to complete optimization
(see next section).

\subsection{Tuning is Fast}\label{sect:fast}
 
 
The number of evaluations/runtimes used by our optimizers is shown in \fig{etimes}
and \fig{ftimes}.
WHERE's runtimes are slower than CART and Random Forest since WHERE has yet to benefit from decades
of implementation experience with these older algorithms. For example, SciKitLearn's  CART and Random Forest
 make extensive use of an underlying ``C'' library whereas WHERE is a purely interpreted Python.

Looking over \fig{etimes} and \fig{ftimes}, the general pattern is that 50 to 80 evaluations suffice for finding the tuning
improvements reported in this paper. 
50 to 80 evaluations is  much less than our pre-experimental intuition.
Prior to this paper, the authors have conducted numerous explorations of evolutionary algorithms
for search-based SE applications~\cite{krall15,krall15:hm,fea02a,me07f,Green}. Based
on that work, our expectations were that non-parametric evolutionary optimization would
take thousands, if not millions, of evaluations of candidate tunings. Hence, originally,
we used Storn's advise on the size of {\em np} and ran our optimizers for 24 hours. 
Then, just
to get a baseline, we tried {\em np=10} and the early stopping rules (number of lives used in
Algorithm~1 on line 5) and obtained the results of this paper



\subsection{Do not use ``off-the-shelf''  Default Tunings}\label{sect:variance}
 
 \fig{preselect} and \fig{fselect} show   tunings learned by DE. 
The left hand side columns shows some standard default values. Note that:
\bi
\item
The tunings learned by DE
were often very different to the default. That is, to achieve the performance improvements seen in the paper,
the default tuning parameters required a wide range of adjustments.
\item The tunings learned by DE were different in different data sets and for different goals.
That is, to achieve the improvements seen in this paper, tuning has to be repeated whenever the goals or data
sets are changed.
\ei
Given this requirement to repeatedly run tuning, it is fortunate that (as shown above)
tuning is so easy and so fast (at least for defect predictors from static code attributes).

\section{Reliability and Validity}\label{sect:construct}


{\em Reliability} refers to the consistency of the results obtained
from the research.  For example,   how well independent researchers
could reproduce the study? To increase external
reliability, this paper has taken care to either  clearly define our
algorithms or use implementations from the public domain
(SciKitLearn). Also, all the data used in this work is available
on-line in the PROMISE code repository and all our algorithms
are on-line at github.com/a-se/where.


{\em Validity} refers to the extent to which a piece of research actually
investigates what the researcher purports to investigate.
{\em Internal validity} checks that if the differences found in
the treatments can be ascribed to the treatments under study. 
One internal validity issue with our experiments is the choice
of {\em training, tuning, and testing} data sets discussed in 
\tion{design}. Recall that while all our learners used the same
{\em testing} data set, our untuned learners were only given
access to {\em training} while DEs could get feedback from
{\em training} and
{\em tuning}.  This mean that, potentially,  the performance increases
reported above are merely an artificat of the DEs being able to access
more data. However:
\bi
\item Note that
DEs assess their performance using a model built from {\em training}
then applied to the {\em tuning} data. If we gave the untuned
learners double the training data, then this would be inherently
biased against DEs.
\item In practice, this is much ado about nothing. We have
repeated all the experiments of this paper with the untuned
learners building models from {\em training} + {\em tuning}.
While the exact numbers found in this way
may differ from the above in some small way, we can report that 
those repeated runs do not substantively change the above conclusions.
\ei
{\em External validity} checks if the results are of relevance
for other cases, or can be generalized from samples
to populations.  
The tuning results shown here only came from one  software analytics task 
(defect prediction from static code attributes).
There are many other kinds of software analytics tasks 
(software development effort estimation, social network mining,
detecting duplicate issue reports, etc) and the implication of this
study for those tasks is unclear. 
However,  those other tasks often use the same kinds of learners
explored in this paper so it is quite possible that
the conclusions of this paper apply to other SE analytics tasks as well. 

That said, there exist some class of data mining papers for which
tuning may not be required. Consider  Le Goues et al.'s 2012
ICSE paper that used a evolutionary program to learn
repairs to code~\cite{leGoues12}. The performance criteria
in that paper was ``can we fix any of the known bugs?''. Note
that this criteria is a ``{\em competency}'' statement, and
not a ``{\em better than}'' statement (the difference being that
one is 
``can do'' and the other is ``can do better''). For such
competency claims, tuning is not necessary. However, as soon
as {\em better than} enters the performance criteria then this
becomes a race between competing methods. In such a race,
it is unfair to hobble one competitor with poor tunings.



\section{Conclusions}

When learning defect predictors for static code
attributes,   analytics without parameter tuning is considered {\em harmful} and {\em misleading}:
\bi
\item Tuning improves the performance scores of a predictor.
That improvement is usually positive (see \fig{deltas}) and sometimes
it can be quite   dramatic (e.g. precision changing from 2\% to 98\%). \item 
Tuning changes conclusions on what learners are better than others.
Hence, it is time to revisit numerous prior publications of our own~\cite{me07b}
and others~\cite{lessmann2008benchmarking,hall11}.
\item
Tuning changes also changes conclusions on what factors are most important in software development.
Once again, this means that old papers may need to be revised including those
some of our own~\cite{me02k} and others~\cite{bell2013limited,rahman2013how,moser2008comparative,zimmermann2007predicting,herzig2013predicting}. 
\ei
Accordingly, we strongly advise that data miners should not be used ``off-the-shelf'' with their default tunings. 
\fig{preselect} and \fig{fselect}    show just how much tuning can alter default settings
both for different data sets and for different goals. 

Since the results from tuning are unstable,
tuning needs to be repeated
whenever data or goals are changed.
Fortunately, the cost of find good tunings is not excessive since, at least for
static code defect predictors, tuning is easy and fast.

As to future work:
\bi
\item
 As noted by
F\"{u}rnkranz~\cite{furnkranz05}, data mining is inherently a multi-objective optimization
problem that seeks the smallest model with the highest performance, 
that generalizes best for
future examples (perhaps learned in minimal time using the least amount of data).
In this view, we are using DE to optimize an optimizer. Perhaps a better approach might be
to dispense with the separation of ``optimizer'' and ``learner'' and combine them both
into one system that learns how to tune itself as it executes. If this view is useful,
then instead of adding elaborations to data miners (as done in this paper, or by researchers
exploring hyper-heuristics~\cite{jia2013learning}), it should be possible to radically simplify optimization and data
mining with a single system that rapidly performs both tasks.
\item
Another issue for future work is the implications of these
conclusions to other kinds of software analytics.
 This paper has explored  {\em some} learners using {\em one}  optimizer. Hence, we can make
no claim that DE is the {\em best} optimizer for {\em all} learners.
Rather, our point is that there exists at least some learners
whose performance can be dramatically improved by 
at least one simple optimization scheme.  We hope that this work inspires
much future work as this community develops and debugs best practices for tuning
software analytics.

\subsection{Implications}

time for an end to era of data mining in se? moving on to a new phase of learning-as-optimization

1) learning is actually an optimization tasks (e.g. see fig2 of  learners climbing the roc curve hill in http://goo.gl/x2EaAm)

2) our learners are all contorted to do some tasks X (e.g. minimize expected value of entropy), then we assess them on score Y (recall). which is nuts. maybe we should build the goal predicate into the learner (e.g http://menzies.us/pdf/10which.pdf) 

3) given 1 + 2, maybe the whole paradigm of optimizing param selection is wrong. maybe what we need is a library of bees buzzing around making random choices (e.g. about descritziation) which other bees use, plus their own random choices (e.g. max depth of tree learned from discretized data) which is used by other bees, plus their own random choices (e.g. business users reading the models).  the funky thing here is that it can take some time before some of the bees (the discretizers) get feedback from the community of people using their decision (the tree learners).
